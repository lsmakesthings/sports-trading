# Legacy Attempt

This is the code I first developed a while ago when I initially had this idea. It is written in Typescript and even though I have now decided to write this project mainly in Rust for performance and security reasons, this code is still useful as a proof of concept and possibly an envirnonment to experiment and prototype my ideas more quickly than in Rust.
